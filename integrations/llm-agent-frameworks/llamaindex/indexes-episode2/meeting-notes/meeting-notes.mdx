Meeting Notes
Date: July 13, 2023
Attendees: Connor (C), Weaviate (W)

Agenda: Exploring Multi-Tenancy with Weaviate's Vector Database

Introduction and Goals of Meeting (B):

Connor explained that the primary goal of the meeting was to discuss how Weaviate's vector database could be integrated into Connor's platform, a photo sharing platform, with a specific focus on multi-tenancy.
Explanation of Vector Databases (W):

Weaviate provided an overview of vector databases, focusing on how they handle high-dimensional data points and efficiently perform similarity searches.
Benefits of Multi-Tenancy (W):

Weaviate explained the concept of multi-tenancy, highlighting its potential for resource sharing, cost reduction, and ease of maintenance. They mentioned that their vector database is capable of supporting multi-tenant architecture.
Connors's Interest in Multi-Tenancy (B):

Connor confirmed the importance of multi-tenancy for their platform. Given that they serve many different users and organizations, it's crucial for them to isolate each tenant's data while still using the same physical infrastructure.
Implementing Multi-Tenancy with Weaviate (W):

Weaviate laid out a preliminary plan for implementing multi-tenancy. This included isolating data on a per-tenant basis, setting up resource quotas and access controls, and providing tools for monitoring and management. They also discussed how the vector search capabilities could be applied on a per-tenant basis.
Concerns and Questions (B):

Connor raised questions about how to handle data migration, backup, and recovery in a multi-tenant setup. They also asked about scalability and performance considerations, including how to ensure one tenant's activities don't impact others'.
Addressing Concerns and Next Steps (B):

Weaviate addressed Connor's concerns, explaining how they handle data management and backups, and assuring them that their system is designed to prevent cross-tenant performance impacts. They proposed a follow-up meeting to delve into technical details and to start planning a potential proof-of-concept integration.
Next Steps: A follow-up meeting will be arranged to discuss technical details, potential challenges, and the planning of a proof-of-concept for the multi-tenant vector database integration.
