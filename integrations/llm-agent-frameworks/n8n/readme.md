## N8n

[N8n](https://n8n.io/) is a low‑code workflow automation platform that lets both technical and non‑technical users build generative AI applications.

## N8n and Weaviate
You can use [n8n’s Weaviate Vector Store node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreweaviate/) to:

1. Inserts documents into a Weaviate collection.
2. Returns ranked documents based on queries from a Weaviate collection.
3. Performs RAG by acting as a tool for AI nodes.
4. Performs agentic RAG by acting as a tool for AI agent nodes.

Check out this [Weaviate N8n template](https://n8n.io/workflows/5817-build-a-weekly-ai-trend-alerter-with-arxiv-and-weaviate/) to build a weekly AI Trend alerter with ArXiv.
