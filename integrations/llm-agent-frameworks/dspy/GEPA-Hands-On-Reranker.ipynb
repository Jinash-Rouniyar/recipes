    "# GEPA Hands-On: Optimized Listwise Reranker\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will illustrate how to use the **GEPA optimizer in DSPy to train a Listwise Reranker**!\n",
    "\n",
    "We find a jump in Recall @ 1 from **32% to 45%** with a GEPA-optimized prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is after a small-scale optimization run with 500 metric calls, running in about an hour and a half. We think it is very likely that we could find a larger gain with a longer optimization run, as indicated by the Pareto frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Rerankers?\n",
    "Rerankers are given as input: (1) a user's query and (2) a list of candidate documents identified by a first stage ranking algorithm, such as Hybrid Search. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rerankers then predict a **new ranking** of the candidate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common forms of rerankers, cross encoders and listwise rerankers. Cross Encoders take as input each query and candidate document in isolation, whereas a Listwise Reranker takes the query and all candidate documents as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook simplifies this task a bit, focusing on identifying the **most** relevant document, or **best match**, rather than a ranking of the entire input set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GEPA Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus of this notebook is to illustrate how you can use the GEPA optimizer to develop AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "GEPA introducs several innovations for prompt optimization such as **Reflective Prompt Mutation**, **System-Aware Merge**, and **Pareto-Optimal Candidate Selection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a conceptual explanation of GEPA, we hope you will find [this conceptual explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czy7hvXIImE) useful, or our [interview with Lakshya A. Agrawal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fREQrxhBSk0). You can also find the [research publication introducing GEPA here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19457).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will aim to help clarify these concepts further by sharing our experience using GEPA!\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are 6 steps in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup DSPy Program `BestMatchReranker`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load Training Dataset (**EnronQA**)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define Metric with Natural Language Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate Unoptimized `BestMatchReranker`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run GEPA Optimizer\n",

      "Process:\n",
      "1) Parse the query carefully. Extract all constraints and qualifiers, including:\n",
      "   - Who the information is attributed to (e.g., “according to Margaret Huson’s email”).\n",
      "   - The medium/source (e.g., “email,” “email signature”).\n",

      "   - Specificity and completeness: Does it provide precise details (e.g., exact date vs “Friday”; two steps vs one)?\n",
      "   - Clarity and correctness: Is the information unambiguous and consistent with the query’s framing?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Compare passages against each other (not just individually). Prefer passages that:\n",
      "   - Explicitly match the named source and medium in the query (e.g., “according to Leslie Lawner’s email,” “listed in Mark Golden’s email signature”). If the query says “according to the email,” deprioritize passages framed as “article,” “column,” or without clear email attribution.\n",
      "   - Contain all key elements the query asks for (e.g., both circumstances “facility’s location and type” and “whether the fire department handles permits” when relevant).\n",
      "   - Provide more specific information (e.g., “January 26” beats “Friday” when both are attributed to the correct email).\n",
      "   - Match the temporal/modality tone of the query (e.g., if the query asks what the Assembly “will try to” do, favor passages that describe intent/plans—“intends to,” “will”—over past-tense “intended” when both otherwise fit).\n",

      "4) Conflict resolution / tie-breakers:\n",
      "   - First, enforce the exact source constraint (named person + email context) if present in the query.\n",

      "\n",
      "Process:\n",
      "1) Parse the query and extract all required elements:\n",
      "   - Entities (people, organizations), dates/times, file names/types, locations, and all subparts explicitly asked (e.g., both “who” and “what topic”).\n",

      "   - Constraint match: Do all named entities, dates, and contexts match the query constraints (e.g., the correct sender and exact date)?\n",

      "\n",
      "3) Resolve conflicts across passages:\n",
      "   - Disqualify passages that contradict key constraints (e.g., wrong person/date, wrong deadline).\n",
      "   - When a query asks for an extremum (“last,” “earliest,” “latest”), prefer the passage that supports the correct extremum (e.g., the latest date/time for “last”).\n",
      "   - Prefer passages that do not introduce unrelated entities or tangents that are not part of the query constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compare remaining candidates and apply tie-breakers in order:\n",
      "   - Exactness to constraints: Prefer the passage that most exactly matches every constraint mentioned in the query (names, dates, file names, context), with no mismatches.\n",
      "   - Explicitness and clarity: Prefer passages that explicitly state the required facts using precise values (e.g., “Friday, December 1 at 2pm” rather than general time windows).\n",
      "   - Focus: Prefer passages that answer the question succinctly without unnecessary extra context (avoid passages that bring in unrelated people or issues not asked).\n",
      "   - Alignment to wording: Prefer passages whose phrasing most closely mirrors the query’s terms and requested granularity (e.g., if the query asks for “last day and time,” prefer a passage that clearly gives both a day and a time and frames it as the last/ultimate deadline).\n",
      "   - If still tied after applying all above, choose the passage with the clearest, most unambiguous statement of the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Return only the id of the single best passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important cautions:\n",
      "- Never pick a passage just because it appears first. Always compare all passages.\n",
      "- Do not rely on meta phrases like “The passage directly addresses the query” alone; verify the actual facts given in the content against the query constraints.\n",
      "- Ensure that all parts of the question are answered. For multi-part questions (e.g., who + what topic), the chosen passage must explicitly cover all parts.\n",
      "- Be strict about sender/date constraints in email/attachment questions. For example, “attached to Robert Michaels’ email on August 18, 2000” must match both the sender and the exact date.\n",
      "- For “last day and time” style queries, select the passage that provides the latest explicit date/time among candidates and states both the date and time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of how to apply these rules (for similar future tasks):\n",
      "- If multiple passages say Barry Tycholiz was initially supposed to meet with Edison’s CFO to discuss hedging Edison’s QF price risk, prefer the one that matches the query precisely and avoids unrelated tangents (e.g., mention of negative CTC payment issues is acceptable context, but introducing unrelated names not in the query may be a negative).\n",
      "- For Haas students’ ticket pickup “last day and time” (Secretary Summers event), favor a passage that explicitly states the final pickup deadline with day and time (e.g., Friday, December 1 at 2pm) over earlier dates (e.g., Nov 28–29) and over passages that provide windows without a definitive last time.\n",
      "- For Jeff’s OAT Valuation Model PowerPoint goal, select the passage that clearly states the intent: to consolidate/present the valuation work (including model refinements and financial data) for communication/review; avoid passages that are vague or only imply the goal.\n",
      "- For attachment names like Robert Michaels’ 8/18/2000 email, select the passage that exactly matches both sender and date and provides the specific file name (e.g., “818 Malloy California Report (Michaels).xls”)—exclude passages with different senders/dates or unrelated attachments.\n",
      "- For CPUC fee statement deadlines from Jeremy Meier’s email to Jeff Dasovich, prefer the passage specifying both conditions (e.g., submit by October 15, 2000, or by November 15, 2000 if amounts billed are zero), not passages that give incomplete timing (e.g., “by the 15th” without month).\n",

      "   - Precision: Does it provide an explicit value when the query asks for one (e.g., a specific date vs. a relative timeframe; a named person vs. general context)?\n",
      "   - Correct subject/entity: Ensure the passage refers to the correct entity (e.g., PG&E vs. Edison; DC Circuit outcome vs. general FCC background).\n",
      "   - Clarity and completeness: Does it cover all key aspects of the query (e.g., both “outcome” and the specific issues like “physical collocation and cage-to-cage cross connections”)?\n",
      "3. Compare top candidates against each other (not just individually). Apply tie-breakers in this priority order:\n",
      "   a) Exact source/context match in the query (e.g., explicitly mentions the specified email/person/notice).\n",

      "  - dataset_id: a source identifier (do not return this)\n",
      "\n",
      "Core instructions:\n",
      "1) Read the query carefully and extract all constraints:\n",
      "   - Who/what is the authoritative source? (e.g., “According to Sarah’s email”)\n",
      "   - What exactly is being asked? (a specific entity, date/month, or an exact list of two items)\n",
      "   - Context specificity (e.g., “the issue at hand,” “to Jeff Dasovich”)\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Directness: Does it directly answer the question asked (entity/date/two items/etc.)?\n",
      "   - Exact attribution: If the query cites a specific source (e.g., “According to Mark Schroeder’s email”), does the passage explicitly attribute the statement to that source? Prefer passages that clearly say it is from that person’s email or a “direct statement from [person].”\n",
      "   - Specificity and completeness: Does it provide the precise item(s) requested (e.g., the single entity, the exact month/date, or both items when asked for “two things”) without omitting parts?\n",
      "   - Consistency with the query’s context: Ensure the passage addresses the same issue/event/person named, not a related but different one.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Strongly use cues in passage content:\n",
      "   - Positive signals: “directly addresses the query,” “contains a direct statement from [person],” “explicitly identifies [entity/date],” “highly relevant and complete.”\n",
      "   - Negative signals: “somewhat relevant,” “partially addresses,” “does not mention [named person/email],” “does not directly answer,” “lacks explicit information,” “however … does not specify …”.\n",
      "   Passages with negative signals should be deprioritized or excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compare passages against each other (not just individually):\n",
      "   - If multiple passages are plausible, prefer the one that satisfies more query constraints:\n",
      "     a) Exact attribution to the named source in the query (must match the person/email specified).\n",
      "     b) Direct, explicit answer (no ambiguity; names the required entity/date/items).\n",
      "     c) Complete coverage (e.g., if “two things” are asked, both are listed in that passage).\n",
      "     d) Fewer caveats/hedges and higher clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Conflict resolution:\n",

      "\n",
      "6) Tie-breakers (apply in order only if still tied after steps 1–5):\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage whose content most explicitly references the named source and the exact requested fact with minimal extraneous context.\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage with fewer hedging words (“somewhat,” “partially,” “does not explicitly,” etc.).\n",
      "   - If still tied, select the passage with the highest SearchResult.id.\n",

      "  - Example pitfall: Queries about James Steffes’ email—ensure the passage naming the entity (e.g., NPC) is explicitly tied to his email, not CPUC, SDG&E, or a “Government Affairs team.”\n",
      "- Exact fact type matters:\n",
      "  - Dates/months: If the query asks “what month” (e.g., overcharging in California in Mark Schroeder’s email), prefer the passage that explicitly states “December” in Mark Schroeder’s email, not a passage talking about October/January or refund applicability dates without attribution to his email.\n",
      "  - Meeting schedules: If the query asks “According to Sarah’s email, when is the first FERC meeting after the July meetings?”, prefer the passage explicitly tied to Sarah’s email that states “September 12” and recognizes the August recess, over passages listing other meetings (e.g., October RTO meetings) or discussing July meetings without the “first after July.”\n",
      "- When asked for “two things,” the best passage must list exactly those two items stated by the named source in the specified email (e.g., Hap Boyd to Jeff Dasovich: pass the Edison MOU bill to get past dues and secure a five-year fixed energy price on ISO4 contracts), not other plausible goals like “delivery up to nameplate capacity” or “transmission access” unless those are the ones asked.\n",
      "- Flexibility/strategy queries (e.g., EVP/CIO’s desired level of flexibility): Prefer passages that clearly describe the stated preference (short-term, nonfirm service with option to switch to long-term, firm if cost savings justify) and are attributed to the EVP/CIO’s direction.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) Directness and explicitness:\n",
      "   - Prefer passages that explicitly and directly state the information requested (e.g., a stated deadline “Friday” in the specified email is preferred over a different passage with specific calendar dates if that other passage is not from the specified source).\n",
      "   - Avoid passages that merely imply the answer or discuss related context without clearly stating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Content match to key terms in the query:\n",
      "   - When the query names specific outcomes/details, favor passages that explicitly include those terms (e.g., “ratepayers revolt” and “political backlash” for consequences attributed to Gov. Gray Davis) rather than loosely related or differently phrased consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Completeness and clarity:\n",
      "   - Among source- and scope-matching candidates that state the answer, prefer the one that is most complete and unambiguous (e.g., includes both email and phone for “contact information,” or provides venue and any corroborating details if consistent with the query’s source).\n",
      "   - If there are conflicting answers (e.g., different venues), choose the one that aligns with the specified source (“according to the email invitation”) and is corroborated by other consistent details in the passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Cross-comparison:\n",
      "   - Compare candidates against each other. Do not select a passage that is less aligned with the query constraints just because it is more detailed. Source/context correctness and exact constraint matching outrank extra detail.\n",

      "Tie-breakers (apply only if still tied after all criteria above):\n",
      "- Prefer the passage whose description most explicitly mirrors the query’s constraints (names, dates, subject line, role like “email invitation,” etc.).\n",
      "- Prefer descriptions that assert they “directly address the query,” “fully satisfy the query,” and indicate “no notable gaps,” when all other factors are equal.\n",
      "- If still tied, select the passage that provides the most precise phrasing of the requested item (e.g., “exact contact details” over “specific contact details”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Important domain reminders from past pitfalls:\n",
      "- “According to [person]’s email” must be satisfied by a passage that attributes the information to that person’s email, even if it only states a relative deadline like “Friday.”\n",
      "- Event/date specificity matters (e.g., “January 10–11 Gas Accord II Workshop”): exclude passages about different dates even if they include the same RSVP contact.\n",
      "- When a query references an email subject line (e.g., “Re: Netscape”), ensure the selected passage ties to that subject/context.\n",
      "- For consequences related to Gov. Gray Davis in FERC/Dana’s notes contexts, look for explicit mentions like “ratepayers revolt” and “political backlash.”\n",

      "How to choose the best passage:\n",
      "1. Parse the query carefully and extract all constraints and requested elements:\n",
      "   - Who/what is being cited (“according to [sender]”, “subject …”, “on [date/time]”).\n",
      "   - What is being asked (e.g., a title, URL, authority/parties, location, expectations, case name).\n",

      "   - Context alignment: Does it explicitly match the cited document context (sender, subject, date/time) “according to the email/update/proposal” mentioned in the query?\n",
      "   - Specificity and exactness: Does it provide the exact string requested (e.g., precise URL, exact study title, exact case name), not just related discussion?\n",
      "   - Accuracy/consistency: Avoid passages that omit a required actor/detail (e.g., mentioning only Assembly leadership but not the Governor when both are required).\n",
      "   - Clarity and lack of ambiguity.\n",

      "     b) Use the same key terms/names as the query (e.g., the exact study title, exact report name, exact URL).\n",
      "     c) Include all required parties/details (e.g., both “legislative leadership” AND “the Governor”).\n",

      "4. Tie-breaking (use in this order):\n",
      "   - Passage that explicitly matches all cited metadata (sender, subject, date/time) of the query’s referenced document.\n",
      "   - Passage that provides the exact requested string(s) (verbatim title/URL/names) rather than paraphrase.\n",
      "   - Passage that mentions the specific document type/context named (e.g., “email”, “update”, “proposal”) rather than general context.\n",
      "   - Passage that is most comprehensive for the specific query (covers all parts with clear, direct statements).\n",
      "   - If still tied, choose the passage with the highest overlap of exact query terms (proper nouns, titles, URLs, dates).\n",

      "   - Prefer passages that explicitly and unambiguously match ALL these constraints.\n",

      "     - Use speculative/hedging language (“appears,” “could be”) rather than explicit confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Directness of the answer:\n",
      "   - Favor passages that explicitly state the answer to the exact question type (who/what/when/where/which) with minimal inference needed.\n",
      "   - Prefer “directly addresses the query by stating …” over “relates to,” “partially answers,” or context-only descriptions.\n",
      "   - When the question asks for a type/category (e.g., “What type of contracts were made available?”), choose the passage that names that type precisely (e.g., “executed contracts, including gas-indexed contracts”) rather than a broader or different characterization (e.g., “38 power purchase contracts”) unless the query asks for counts or additional details.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Alignment with cited source context:\n",
      "   - If the query specifies a source (e.g., “according to Alan Comnes’ email,” “article quoted in the email”), prefer passages that explicitly anchor the information to that source context over generalized summaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Completeness and clarity:\n",
      "   - If multiple passages meet the above, prefer the one that is clear, concise, and fully sufficient to answer the query without unnecessary extra detail not requested.\n",
      "   - Avoid selecting a “more comprehensive” passage if it drifts from the exact ask or introduces extraneous specifics not required by the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Tie-breakers (apply sequentially only if still tied after 1–4):\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage whose description most closely mirrors the query’s key phrasing and qualifiers (e.g., explicitly mentions “executed (not agreements-in-principle)” when that nuance matters).\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage that explicitly mentions more of the query’s qualifiers (exact date, room number, named individual, organization) that are relevant to the ask.\n",
      "   - Prefer passages that avoid hedging or ambiguity.\n",
      "   - Final deterministic tie-break: choose the passage with the higher search_result id.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important domain reminders from prior cases:\n",
      "- Giants vs Raiders: Ensure the team/event matches exactly; do not substitute similar contexts.\n",
      "- DWR Stranded Cost Update (Alan Comnes’ email): The correct “type of contracts” is “executed contracts” (often including gas-indexed contracts); downrank passages that pivot to counts or unrelated summaries if the query asks specifically for type.\n",
      "- California Power Exchange CEO disputing FERC’s claim: The CEO is George Sladoje; ensure the passage explicitly ties the role (CEO) and the action (disputed FERC’s claim) together.\n",
      "- Career seminar specificity: Match the exact seminar (e.g., “CAREER DECISION MAKING,” Saturday, October 27th, room S420) and return the passage listing its key focus areas.\n",

      "  - “First after [month/event]”: Recognize sequences, recesses, or gaps (e.g., August recess) when specified in the attributed source. If Sarah’s email states “the first FERC meeting after the July meetings is September 12,” prefer that.\n",

Extra context like “contracts expiring on or before 12-31-05” may be present; it is acceptable if the core cutoff and contrast are explicit.\n",

      "1) Parse the query carefully. Extract all constraints:\n",
      "   - Attribution: Does the query specify a source (“According to [person]”, “[person]’s email/message”)? If so, the selected passage must be attributable to that exact source.\n",

      "\n",
      "2) Evaluate ALL passages against the query simultaneously. For each passage, check:\n",
      "   - Directness: Does the passage directly and explicitly state the requested item(s) (the entity/date/phone number/two items)?\n",
      "   - Exact attribution: If the query names a source, prefer passages that explicitly attribute the statement to that source or clearly indicate it’s from that person’s email/message. Do not accept passages attributed to a different person/entity.\n",
      "   - Specificity and completeness: The passage should provide the full, exact item(s) requested (e.g., both items if “two things” are asked; the exact date/month; the single, specific entity or phone number).\n",
      "   - Context match: Ensure it addresses the exact event/person/timing described in the query (e.g., “after the rescheduled December 4th meeting,” not merely “after November 30th”).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Strongly use cues in passage content summaries:\n",
      "   - Positive signals: “directly addresses the query,” “contains a direct statement from [person],” “explicitly identifies [entity/date/number],” “highly relevant and complete,” “states [X] is [answer].”\n",

      "\n",
      "4) Conflict resolution and prioritization:\n",
      "   - Attribution first: If the query cites “According to [person]” (or “[person]’s email/message”), prioritize passages explicitly tied to that person. However, do not choose a passage merely because it mentions the person if it fails to explicitly provide the requested item(s).\n",
      "   - Exactness of the requested item: If one passage explicitly names the precise entity/date/number/items and another uses ambiguous or grouped labels (e.g., “UC/CSU” when the asked-for entity is “CSU”), select the passage that explicitly names the requested item.\n",
      "   - Version sensitivity: If multiple passages conflict but are all attributed to the same person:\n",
      "     - If the query simply says “according to [person]’s email/message” and does NOT mention “updated,” “corrected,” or “future,” prefer the passage that reads like the original statement (avoid passages emphasizing “updated number,” “will be used for all future calls,” or similar forward-looking context).\n",
      "     - If the query explicitly says “updated” or “revised,” prefer the passage indicating the update.\n",
      "   - Context qualifiers: When timing/sequence is part of the query (e.g., “after the rescheduled December 4th meeting,” “first meeting after the July meetings”), prefer passages that repeat that qualifier verbatim or restate it clearly and then give the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Tie-breaking (apply strictly in this order only if passages remain equally strong after steps 1–4):\n",
      "   a) Prefer the passage whose wording most closely mirrors the query’s phrasing and constraints (e.g., if the query says “expected to finish/complete,” prefer summaries that say “expected to complete” over generic “deadline” phrasing).\n",
      "   b) Prefer the passage that states the exact answer plainly with minimal extraneous context (avoid passages with additional, unnecessary details like “will be used for all future calls,” unless the query asks for that).\n",
      "   c) Prefer the passage that includes all pertinent qualifiers from the query (e.g., repeats “rescheduled December 4th”).\n",
      "   d) Prefer passages with stronger positive signals and no hedging or caveats.\n",
      "   e) Only if still truly indistinguishable, select the passage with the highest SearchResult.id.\n",

      "  - Angie Buis TAR&L meetings: The meeting scheduled after the rescheduled December 4th meeting is December 7th. Prefer passages that explicitly reference the “rescheduled December 4th” qualifier and then state December 7th.\n",

      "  - Dates/months: If the query asks “what month/date,” prefer the passage that explicitly states the exact month/date attributed to the named source.\n",
      "  - “Two things”: The best passage must list exactly those two items as stated by the named source in the specified email.\n",
      "  - Quotes vs paraphrases: If the query does not ask for a quote, prefer the passage that states the fact plainly and unambiguously over colorful or idiomatic phrasing—unless the quote is the only direct statement from the named source.\n",
      "- Meeting schedules:\n",
      "  - When asked “According to Angie Buis … after the rescheduled December 4 meeting,” prefer a passage that explicitly mentions the meeting following the rescheduled December 4 date (answer: December 7). If multiple passages state December 7 with equivalent attribution, apply the tie-breakers and, if still tied, pick the highest id.\n",
      "  - When asked “first meeting after the July meetings,” be aware of August recess; “September 12” may be the correct “first after July” per the explicitly named source.\n",
      "- Authority queries:\n",
      "  - If asked who has authority to reconvene the California Legislature before a date, prefer passages that state “either legislative leadership or the Governor” (if that is what the named source’s email says). Avoid passages that mention only Assembly or Senate leadership if the named source includes the Governor or broader authority.\n",
      "- Legislative/bill context:\n",
      "  - For Jeff Dasovich’s July 3, 2001 email about language on bonds: the risk he notes is that attempting to modify the bill could cause the entire legislative effort to fail. Prefer the neutral, explicit articulation of the risk unless the query asks for the exact quote.\n",
      "  - For Hap Boyd to Jeff Dasovich “two things,” the correct pair is: pass the Edison MOU bill to get past dues and secure a five-year fixed energy price on ISO4 contracts (avoid swapping in other plausible goals).\n",
      "- Edison/QF/CTC domain:\n",
      "  - If asked who was supposed to meet Edison's CFO and what topic: Barry Tycholiz; topic was hedging Edison's QF price risk. Negative CTC context is ancillary; ensure the passage directly provides the named person and topic.\n",
      "- UI deal attribution:\n",
      "  - In Jeff Dasovich’s email chain, the email about the UI deal is credited to Jim Steffes (or “Jim” where clearly attributed as Jim Steffes). Prefer the passage that explicitly attributes this to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolute rules:\n",
      "- Never combine information across passages; select the single best passage that alone satisfies the query.\n",
      "- Never infer beyond what the passage content asserts about attribution and the requested fact.\n",

      "\n",
      "Core decision process (follow in order):\n",
      "1) Parse the query and extract all constraints:\n",
      "   - Source attribution: person and medium (e.g., “According to Sarah’s email,” “Jeff Dasovich’s July 3, 2001 email”).\n",
      "   - What is being asked: exact answer type (single entity, date/month/time, “two things,” etc.).\n",
      "   - Context qualifiers: subject, issue/event, recipient/audience, timing qualifiers (“first after July,” “following the rescheduled December 4 meeting,” “the email that prompted his response,” “article quoted in the email,” etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Evaluate ALL passages against the full set of query constraints simultaneously. For each passage, check:\n",
      "   - Directness: Does it explicitly answer what is asked (the exact entity/date/time/two items)?\n",
      "   - Exact attribution: If the query names a specific person and/or email, does the passage clearly attribute the statement to that exact person/email (ideally matching any date/subject/context when stated)?\n",
      "   - Specificity and completeness: Does it provide the precise, complete item(s) requested, without omission or added inference?\n",
      "   - Context match: Does it address the same issue/event/person/timing stated in the query (e.g., “the email that prompted [X]’s response,” “article quoted in the email,” “first after July,” “regarding language on bonds”)?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Strongly use cues in passage content summaries. Treat these phrases as decisive:\n",
      "   - Positive signals: “directly addresses the query,” “contains a direct statement from [person],” “explicitly identifies [entity/date/time/items],” “highly relevant and complete,” “clearly states [X] in [person]’s email,” “exact date and time of the prompting email,” “from the article quoted in the email.”\n",
      "   - Negative signals: “somewhat relevant,” “partially addresses,” “does not mention [named person/email],” “does not directly answer,” “lacks explicit information,” “however … does not specify …,” “inferred,” “implied,” “context around but not explicit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compare plausible passages against each other (not just individually) and prefer the one that satisfies more constraints:\n",
      "   a) Exact attribution to the named source in the query (prefer passages that explicitly tie the fact to the specific person’s email; if the query includes a date/subject/timing, prefer passages that align with that).\n",
      "   b) Direct, explicit answer to the exact requested fact(s) with no ambiguity (e.g., exact date/time, exact two items).\n",
      "   c) Complete coverage (e.g., if “two things” are asked, both items appear in that single passage).\n",
      "   d) Closer lexical match to the query’s phrasing/qualifiers (e.g., explicitly mentions “the email that prompted his response,” “article quoted in the email,” “expected to finish submitting,” “rescheduled December 4,” “first after July”).\n",
      "   e) Fewer hedges and minimal extraneous context. Prefer passages that match the query’s words (e.g., “expected to finish submitting”) over looser synonyms (e.g., “deadline”) when both are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Conflict resolution:\n",
      "   - If passages disagree on the core fact, select the one that:\n",
      "     a) Attributes the statement to the exact source named in the query (the specific person/email), and\n",
      "     b) Most explicitly and unambiguously states the requested fact(s).\n",
      "   - Discard passages that attribute the answer to a different person/entity than the one named in the query or that discuss a related but different issue.\n",
      "   - Do not select passages that add goals/purposes not explicitly attributed in the source when the query asks “according to [person]’s email.” Prefer faithful summaries of what the email states over inferred or embellished motivations.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Special precision rules for frequent query patterns:\n",
      "   - “Prompted email” vs “response email”:\n",
      "     • If asked for the “email that prompted [X]’s response,” do NOT return a passage that gives the date/time of the response email. Prefer passages that explicitly provide the date/time of the prompting email (the one that triggered the response).\n",
      "   - “Article quoted in the email”:\n",
      "     • Prefer passages that clearly state the facts come from the quoted article (e.g., specific poll numbers, popularity shifts), not general background. Numeric polling data and explicit popularity impacts are strong signals.\n",
      "   - Deadlines/dates/times:\n",
      "     • Prefer passages that include the full date with year and exact phrasing matching the query (e.g., “expected to finish submitting by November 17, 2000”) over passages that omit the year or only say “November 17th” or “deadline” when the query uses “expected to finish.”\n",
      "   - “Two things”:\n",
      "     • The single selected passage must contain exactly the two items requested; do not combine across passages.\n",
      "   - Quotes vs paraphrases:\n",
      "     • If the query does not ask for a quote, prefer passages that state the fact plainly and unambiguously as attributed to the named source. Avoid colorful/idiomatic phrasing unless it is the only explicit statement from the named source.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Domain-specific guidance and common pitfalls (apply when relevant to the query):\n",
      "   - Meeting schedules:\n",
      "     • When asked “According to Angie Buis … after the rescheduled December 4 meeting,” the correct answer may be “December 7.” Prefer a passage that explicitly mentions the meeting following the rescheduled December 4 date. If multiple passages state December 7 with equivalent attribution, apply tie-breakers and, if still tied, pick the highest id.\n",
      "     • When asked “first meeting after the July meetings,” account for August recess; “September 12” may be correct if explicitly stated by the named source.\n",
      "   - Authority to reconvene the California Legislature:\n",
      "     • Prefer passages that state “either legislative leadership or the Governor” if that’s what the named source’s email says. Avoid answers mentioning only Assembly or Senate leadership if the named source includes the Governor or broader authority.\n",
      "   - Legislative/bill context:\n",
      "     • For Jeff Dasovich’s July 3, 2001 email about language on bonds: the risk is that attempting to modify the bill could cause the entire legislative effort to fail. Prefer a neutral, explicit articulation of this risk unless a quote is requested.\n",
      "   - Hap Boyd to Jeff Dasovich “two things”:\n",
      "     • The correct pair: pass the Edison MOU bill to get past dues, and secure a five-year fixed energy price on ISO4 contracts. Avoid substituting other plausible goals.\n",
      "   - Edison/QF/CTC:\n",
      "     • If asked who was supposed to meet Edison’s CFO and on what topic: Barry Tycholiz; topic: hedging Edison’s QF price risk. Negative CTC context is ancillary—ensure the passage directly provides the named person and topic.\n",
      "   - UI deal attribution:\n",
      "     • In Jeff Dasovich’s email chain, the email about the UI deal is credited to Jim Steffes (or “Jim” where clearly attributed as Jim Steffes). Prefer passages that explicitly attribute this to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Tie-breakers (apply only if still tied after steps 1–7; do not skip):\n",
      "   1) Prefer the passage that most explicitly references the named source and the exact requested fact/qualifier in the query’s wording (e.g., explicitly says “the email that prompted [X]’s response,” “from the article quoted in the email,” “expected to finish submitting,” etc.).\n",
      "   2) Prefer passages with the most precise data format required by the query (e.g., full date with year; exact time).\n",
      "   3) Prefer the passage with fewer hedging words (“somewhat,” “partially,” “implies,” “inferred”).\n",
      "   4) If still tied, select the passage with the highest SearchResult.id.\n",
      "   Note: Do not choose based on being “first in the list” or subjective concision if earlier tie-breakers don’t separate candidates. Always apply the final “highest id” rule only after the earlier tie-breakers fail to separate candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolute rules:\n",
      "- Never combine information across passages; select the single best passage that alone satisfies the query.\n",

      "\n",
      "2) Rigorously evaluate ALL passages against ALL constraints:\n",
      "   - Directness: Does the passage explicitly provide the requested fact(s) in the requested form (the exact person, date, filename, two items, etc.)?\n",
      "   - Exact attribution: If the query names a specific person and medium (and possibly date/subject), prefer passages that clearly attribute the statement to that exact person and, when available, that exact email/date/subject/article context.\n",
      "   - Specificity and completeness: The passage should provide exactly and fully what is asked (e.g., both items for “two things,” the precise month/date, the exact filename).\n",
      "   - Context match: It must match the issue/event/timing qualifiers in the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Use content-summary signals aggressively:\n",
      "   - Strong positives: “directly answers,” “directly addresses,” “contains a direct statement from [person],” “explicitly identifies [entity/date/items/filename],” “clearly states [X] in [person]’s email,” “highly relevant and complete,” “precise and unambiguous.”\n",
      "   - Strong negatives: “somewhat relevant,” “partially addresses,” “does not mention [named person/email],” “does not directly answer,” “lacks explicit information,” “however … does not specify …,” different sender/date/subject, hedging or ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compare plausible passages side-by-side and prefer the one that satisfies more constraints:\n",
      "   a) Exact attribution to the named source/medium (and, when present, matching date/time and subject line).\n",
      "   b) Most direct, explicit, and unambiguous statement of the requested fact(s) (minimal paraphrase; no inference).\n",
      "   c) Complete coverage within a single passage (e.g., both items if “two things” is requested).\n",
      "   d) Lexical alignment: closer wording to the query’s phrasing and qualifiers (e.g., “rescheduled December 4,” “first after July,” “who has authority,” “Language on bonds,” “attached file name”).\n",
      "   e) Minimal extraneous or sensational context; prefer neutral, plain articulation of the fact unless the query asks for a quote.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Conflict resolution:\n",
      "   - If passages disagree, select the one that:\n",
      "     a) Attributes the statement to the exact named source/medium (the specific person’s email or the specific article), and\n",
      "     b) States the requested fact(s) most explicitly and unambiguously.\n",
      "   - Discard passages attributed to a different person or to general context when the query requires a named individual/email.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Strict tie-handling (apply only after exhausting 4a–4e thoroughly):\n",
      "   - Before invoking any final tie-breaker, scrutinize micro-differences:\n",
      "     • Prefer summaries that mention the exact email metadata (date/time, subject) or explicitly say the fact is from the specified email/article.\n",
      "     • Prefer passages that reproduce or closely mirror the named source’s phrasing relevant to the query (including quoted terms) over looser paraphrases.\n",

      "Absolute cautions:\n",
      "- Do not infer or “merge” facts across passages.\n",
      "- If the query specifies a person’s email (and especially a date/subject), prioritize passages that explicitly tie the fact to that email over more general articles or summaries.\n",
      "- When identifying filenames or exact wording, prefer passages that clearly state the precise string.\n",

      "1) Read the query carefully and extract the precise information need (who/what/when/how, the exact phrasing sought, and any source constraint like “According to the email/email chain”).\n",
      "2) Evaluate ALL passages against the query simultaneously. For each passage, assess:\n",
      "   - Directness: Does it explicitly and fully answer the question as asked?\n",
      "   - Anchoring to the source: If the query says “According to the email/email chain,” prefer passages that explicitly present what the email(s) say over generic or interpretive summaries.\n",
      "   - Completeness and specificity: Does it include the exact element asked (e.g., the precise deadline phrase, the exact greeting wording, the specific funding mechanism)?\n",
      "   - Precision and neutrality: Avoid passages that add interpretations or claims beyond what’s asked (e.g., calling a relationship “close” when the email only shows “cordial”).\n",
      "   - Clarity and correctness: Is the information unambiguous and accurate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Key domain cues and disambiguation:\n",
      "- Department of Water Resources = DWR. The specific mechanism “reductions from payments made to the DWR” is distinct from other mechanisms like “overcollections recovered via a non-bypassable rate” or “assessments by the Electric Rate Stabilization Authority.” When the query asks about funding mechanisms for demand reduction initiatives for direct access (DA) customers, prefer the passage that explicitly states “reductions from payments made to the DWR.”\n",
      "- Direct Access customers may be abbreviated as DA; ISO refers to Independent System Operator. Prefer passages that match the query’s mechanism and scope exactly.\n",
      "- Deadlines: Prefer the exact phrase used in the email (e.g., “sometime on Monday”) over paraphrases (e.g., “by Monday”) if the query asks “what was the deadline.”\n",
      "- Greetings: For FT.com email greetings, acceptable variants include “Dear FT.com user” and “Dear FT.com User:”. Prefer the passage that gives the exact greeting phrase as used, including punctuation if present.\n",
      "- Relationship status in emails: Prefer passages that state only what is evidenced (e.g., “they have met before and are on friendly enough terms to consider a joint birthday party”) over passages that add stronger, potentially speculative characterizations (e.g., “close and friendly bond”) unless explicitly supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparison and selection:\n",
      "- Compare the top candidate passages against each other, not just individually, and select the ONE that most literally and precisely answers the question with minimal speculation.\n",
      "- When multiple passages seem equally relevant:\n",
      "  1) Prefer the one that uses the query’s key terms verbatim or closest paraphrase (e.g., “reductions from payments to the DWR,” “sometime on Monday,” “Dear FT.com User:”).\n",
      "  2) Prefer passages that explicitly tie the information to “the email/email chain” if the query is framed that way.\n",
      "  3) Prefer the most concise and directly stated answer without added commentary or assumptions.\n",
      "  4) If still tied, pick the passage with the lowest id.\n",

      "\n",
      "Core decision process (apply in order):\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Parse the query and extract all constraints:\n",
      "   - Source attribution: specific person and medium (email, memo, notice, invitation), and any date/subject context.\n",
      "   - What is being asked: the exact answer type (single entity/person, date/month/day, “two things,” “which type,” etc.).\n",
      "   - Context qualifiers: subject/issue/event/person, audience/recipient, timing qualifiers (“first after July,” “following the rescheduled December 4 meeting,” etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Evaluate ALL passages against the full set of query constraints simultaneously. For each passage, check:\n",
      "   - Directness: Does it explicitly answer what is asked (the exact entity/date/month/two items/phrase)?\n",
      "   - Exact attribution: If the query names a specific person/source and/or medium, does the passage clearly attribute the statement to that exact person/source/medium (ideally matching any date/subject/timing qualifiers)?\n",
      "   - Specificity and completeness: Does it provide the precise, complete item(s) requested in a single passage (e.g., both items for a “two things” query), without omission or ambiguity?\n",
      "   - Context match: Does it address the same issue/event/person/timing stated in the query?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Strongly use cues in passage content summaries:\n",
      "   - Positive signals: “directly addresses the query,” “contains a direct statement from [person/source],” “explicitly identifies [entity/date/items],” “highly relevant and complete,” “clearly states [X] in [person]’s email/memo/notice/invitation.”\n",
      "   - Negative signals: “somewhat relevant,” “partially addresses,” “does not mention [named person/email/memo/notice],” “does not directly answer,” “lacks explicit information,” “however … does not specify …”.\n",
      "   Passages with negative signals should be deprioritized or excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compare plausible passages against each other and prefer the one that satisfies more constraints:\n",
      "   a) Exact attribution to the named source in the query (prefer passages that explicitly tie the fact to the specific person and medium; if the query includes a date/subject/timing, prefer passages that align with that).\n",
      "   b) Direct, explicit answer to the exact requested fact(s) with no ambiguity.\n",
      "   c) Complete coverage within a single passage (e.g., if “two things” are asked, both items must be present in that one passage).\n",
      "   d) Closer lexical match to the query’s phrasing/qualifiers (e.g., explicitly mentions “rescheduled December 4,” “first after July,” “who has authority,” etc.).\n",
      "   e) Fewer hedges and minimal extraneous context.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Conflict resolution:\n",
      "   - If passages disagree on the core fact, select the one that:\n",
      "     a) Attributes the statement to the exact source named in the query (the specific person/email/memo/notice/invitation), and\n",
      "     b) Most explicitly and unambiguously states the requested fact(s).\n",
      "   - Discard passages that attribute the answer to a different person/entity than the one named in the query or that discuss a related but different issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Precision on answer type and phrasing:\n",
      "   - If the query asks for a specific type/label/phrase (e.g., “which type of services”), prefer the passage that provides the exact type/label used by the named source over expanded lists or interpretive summaries, unless the query explicitly asks for a list.\n",
      "   - Dates/months: Prefer the passage that explicitly states the exact date/month attributed to the named source over relative references (e.g., prefer “January 26” over “Friday” if the query expects a date).\n",
      "   - “Two things”: The best passage must list exactly those two items as stated by the named source in the specified message.\n",
      "   - Quotes vs paraphrases: If a paraphrase provides a clearer, unambiguous statement from the named source and the query does not require a direct quote, prefer the clearer paraphrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Strict tie-breakers (apply only if still tied after steps 1–6; do not skip):\n",
      "   1) Prefer the passage that most explicitly references the named source and the exact requested fact/qualifier in the query’s wording.\n",
      "   2) Prefer the passage with fewer hedging words (“somewhat,” “partially,” “does not explicitly,” etc.).\n",
      "   3) If still tied, select the passage with the highest SearchResult.id.\n",

      "Important domain-specific guidance and common pitfalls to avoid:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- CAISO Notice on Tariff revisions:\n",
      "  - When asked the purpose of the Tariff revisions the ISO will file with FERC “according to the CAISO Notice,” prefer the passage that states the revisions are intended to formalize/reflect the temporary suspension of preliminary invoice settlements and the consolidation of those funds with final settlements, due to market reruns, large invoice adjustments, and payment failures by Scheduling Coordinators. Deprioritize passages describing different objectives (e.g., generic “three main actions”) if they are not the CAISO Notice purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mary Schoen’s memo (back-up generation run hour limitations):\n",
      "  - The memo’s key phrase is that back-up generation at “essential public services” is exempt from run hour limitations. If the query asks “which type of services,” prefer the passage that uses the exact type label “essential public services” attributed to Mary Schoen’s memo over passages that enumerate categories not explicitly requested or not clearly attributed to the memo.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fisher Center Conference (email invitation):\n",
      "  - Venue: Wells Fargo Room at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley. Some invitations also mention a reception at the Bank of America Forum. If the query asks for the conference venue “according to the email invitation,” prefer passages that clearly state “Wells Fargo Room at Haas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- Leslie Lawner’s email (ORA/TURN petition due date):\n",
      "  - Prefer a passage that provides the explicit date “January 26” if available and clearly attributed to Leslie Lawner’s email. Only prefer “Friday” if that is the most specific attribution available and the query does not require a specific date.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Meeting schedules:\n",
      "  - “After the rescheduled December 4 meeting” (per Angie Buis): the meeting that follows is December 7. Prefer passages that explicitly mention this linkage and attribution.\n",
      "  - “First meeting after the July meetings”: be aware of August recess; “September 12” may be correct per the named source.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Authority queries (California Legislature reconvening):\n",
      "  - If asked who has authority to reconvene before a date (per the named source), the correct formulation may be “either legislative leadership or the Governor.” Avoid narrower attributions (e.g., Assembly or Senate only) if the named source includes the Governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Legislative/bill context:\n",
      "  - Jeff Dasovich’s July 3, 2001 email regarding language on bonds: the risk he notes is that trying to modify the bill could cause the entire legislative effort to fail. Prefer a neutral, explicit articulation unless the query asks for the exact quote.\n",
      "  - Hap Boyd to Jeff Dasovich “two things”: pass the Edison MOU bill to get past dues and secure a five-year fixed energy price on ISO4 contracts. Ensure both items appear in the same passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Edison/QF/CTC domain:\n",
      "  - If asked who was supposed to meet Edison’s CFO and the topic: Barry Tycholiz; topic was hedging Edison’s QF price risk. Avoid selecting passages that focus on tangential CTC context if they don’t directly provide both the person and the topic.\n",

      "- UI deal attribution:\n",
      "  - In Jeff Dasovich’s email chain, the email about the UI deal is credited to Jim Steffes (or “Jim” where clearly attributable as Jim Steffes). Prefer passages that explicitly attribute this to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolute rules:\n",
      "- Never combine information across passages; select the single best passage that alone satisfies the query.\n",
      "- Never infer beyond what the passage content asserts about attribution and the requested fact.\n",
      "- If multiple passages are effectively identical in satisfying all constraints, apply the tie-breakers in order and, if still tied, return the passage with the highest id.\n",

      "  - Reject passages that refer to a different but similar entity/event.\n",

      "1) Parse the query and extract all constraints:\n",
      "   - Source attribution: exact person and medium (email) and, when present, date, subject line, recipient(s), and timing qualifiers.\n",
      "   - What is being asked: precise answer type (e.g., a single entity, a specific date or month, exact time, “two things”).\n",
      "   - Context qualifiers: the issue/event/person, and timing constraints (e.g., “after the rescheduled December 4 meeting,” “first after July”).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Evaluate ALL passages simultaneously against the full set of constraints:\n",
      "   - Directness: Does the passage explicitly answer what is asked (the exact entity/date/month/time/items)?\n",
      "   - Exact attribution: If the query names a specific person/email (and possibly a date/subject), does the passage clearly attribute the statement to that exact person/email (ideally including matching date/subject/context)?\n",

      "   - Context match: Does it match the same issue/event/person/timing in the query?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Strongly use cues in passage content summaries:\n",
      "   - Positive signals:\n",

      "   Passages with negative signals should be deprioritized or excluded.\n",

Do not select a passage attributed to someone else or to general context.\n",
      "- Exact answer type precision:\n",
      "  - Dates/months/times: If asked “what month/date/time,” prefer the passage that explicitly states the exact month/date/time attributed to the named source.\n",
      "  - “Two things”: The best passage must list exactly those two items as stated by the named source in the specified email.\n",
      "  - Quotes vs paraphrases: If the query does not ask for a quote, prefer a clear, explicit statement of the fact over colorful language—unless the quote is the only direct statement from the named source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important domain-specific guidance and known correct interpretations:\n",
      "- Meeting schedules:\n",
      "  - “According to Angie Buis … after the rescheduled December 4 meeting” → the correct meeting date is December 7. Prefer passages that explicitly mention this with proper attribution.\n",
      "  - “First meeting after the July meetings” may be September 12 per the explicitly named source (consider August recess). Prefer passages that clearly state this with attribution.\n",
      "- Authority queries:\n",
      "  - If asked who has authority to reconvene the California Legislature before a date, prefer passages that state “either legislative leadership or the Governor” if that is what the named source’s email says. Do not pick passages naming only Assembly or Senate leadership if the named source includes the Governor.\n",
      "- Legislative/bill context:\n",
      "  - Jeff Dasovich’s July 3, 2001 email about language on bonds: the risk he notes is that attempting to modify the bill could cause the entire legislative effort to fail. Prefer the neutral, explicit articulation unless the query asks for a quote.\n",
      "- “Two things” (Hap Boyd to Jeff Dasovich): The correct pair is:\n",
      "  1) Pass the Edison MOU bill to get past dues; and\n",
      "  2) Secure a five-year fixed energy price on ISO4 contracts.\n",
      "  Avoid substituting other plausible goals.\n",
      "- Edison/QF/CTC domain:\n",
      "  - If asked who was supposed to meet Edison's CFO and the topic: Barry Tycholiz; topic was hedging Edison's QF price risk. Negative CTC context is ancillary; ensure the passage directly provides the named person and topic.\n",
      "- UI deal attribution:\n",
      "  - In Jeff Dasovich’s email chain, the email about the UI deal is credited to Jim Steffes (or “Jim” where clearly attributed as Jim Steffes). Prefer explicit attribution to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional comparison guidance learned from examples:\n",
      "- When two passages are similar, prefer the one that:\n",

      "  - Avoids unnecessary added characterizations not clearly supported by the summary (e.g., “business trip” vs “must be in Portland for work”).\n",

      "Relevance criteria (apply in order):\n",
      "1) Directness: Prefer passages that explicitly and unambiguously answer the specific question asked (e.g., listing the requested names, stating the requested task, or naming the city).\n",
      "2) Constraint alignment: Prefer passages that match the query’s unique anchors, such as:\n",
      "   - Named people (e.g., Jeremy Blachman, Jimmy, Dan Douglass, Sue Mara, Gov. Gray Davis).\n",
      "   - Email context/metadata (e.g., subject lines like \"Re: Netscape\", specific dates/times).\n",
      "   - Organizations and bodies (e.g., PUC, FERC, California Chamber of Commerce).\n",
      "   - Scope qualifiers (e.g., “other states observing California’s deregulation”).\n",
      "3) Exact focus on the asked aspect: If the question asks for a single, specific item (e.g., “what task did X request with the draft application”), favor the passage that states that exact item and avoid ones that broaden the scope (e.g., adding filing deadlines or unrelated tasks).\n",
      "4) Specificity of requested elements: \n",
      "   - If the query asks for people names, favor passages that clearly identify the participants relevant to the asked context.\n",
      "   - If asking for consequences to “other states,” favor passages that explicitly frame consequences for other states (e.g., “ratepayers revolt” and “political backlash”) over general market commentary.\n",
      "   - If asking for a city, prefer the passage that explicitly states the city (e.g., “Washington, DC”).\n",
      "5) Query-context match: When multiple passages claim to directly answer, prefer the one that mirrors the query’s unique wording/details (e.g., mentions the email subject “Re: Netscape” when the query specifies it).\n",
      "6) Minimize extraneous content: Do not favor passages merely because they add extra context beyond what is asked. Exactness over breadth.\n",
      "7) Tie-breakers:\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage that most closely and neutrally claims to fulfill the query completely and specifically without introducing additional, potentially editorialized specifics that are not requested (e.g., avoid passages that introduce unrelated tasks or reframe the scope).\n",
      "   - If still tied, choose the passage that mentions the most unique identifiers from the query (names, dates, subject line).\n",
      "   - If still tied, pick deterministically by the earliest occurrence in your evaluation order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common pitfalls to avoid (from prior errors):\n",
      "- Do not select a passage that adds extra tasks/details beyond the requested item (e.g., filing deadlines or endorsements) when the query asks for a single task (e.g., “forward the draft to the California Chamber of Commerce for review”).\n",
      "- When the query emphasizes broader implications for other states watching California’s deregulation, prefer the passage explicitly citing “ratepayers revolt” and “political backlash” against FERC over generic market dysfunction.\n",
      "- When the query specifies an email’s subject/date, prefer the passage that references that subject/date and directly ties the years or details to the sender’s perspective.\n",

      "   - Who/attribution: e.g., “according to James Steffes’ email,” “as specified in Frank Lindh’s email,” “according to Mike Day’s proposal,” “mentioned in Joseph Alamo’s email.”\n",
      "   - What information is requested: destination, entity unlikely to act, the case name, the second aspect criticized, RSVP contact info, etc.\n",
      "   - When/where/event: dates (e.g., January 10–11 vs October 25–26), workshops (e.g., Gas Accord II), proceedings (e.g., PG&E Gas Accord II, GRI proceeding), settlements (PG&E and SoCalGas), topics (Direct Access, wholesale market, retail rate cap).\n",
      "   - Issue context: e.g., “return of residential customers to the market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Evaluate each passage based on substance, not on its self-claim of relevance:\n",
      "   - Does it explicitly and unambiguously state the specific answer requested?\n",
      "   - Does it match ALL key qualifiers in the query (attribution/source, event/date, entities)?\n",
      "   - Is the described context the same issue as in the query?\n",
      "   - Does it avoid contradictions, extra/unasked-for destinations or entities, or mixing multiple answers?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Disqualify or down-rank passages that:\n",
      "   - Refer to the wrong event/date (e.g., October vs January when January is asked).\n",
      "   - Mention multiple conflicting answers when the query asks for a single item (e.g., two destinations).\n",
      "   - Provide only context without naming the requested answer.\n",
      "   - Are about a different issue/entity than the one indicated by the query’s attribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Compare candidate passages against each other:\n",
      "   - Prefer passages that explicitly satisfy all constraints (who/what/when/where) with direct statements over those requiring inference.\n",
      "   - Prefer passages that mirror the query’s qualifiers most closely (e.g., explicitly mention the named person’s email/proposal, the exact workshop/case/date).\n",
      "   - Prefer answers that are precise and singular (one destination/entity/case) and avoid extraneous or conflicting details.\n",
      "   - When passages disagree on the answer, choose the one that:\n",
      "     - Ties the answer most clearly to the specified source (e.g., “James Steffes indicated NPC is unlikely to take action on [the stated issue]”).\n",
      "     - Matches the exact context and timeframe in the query.\n",
      "     - Uses definitive phrasing indicating a direct statement rather than vague or inferential language.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Tie-breaking (only if candidates remain truly equal after the above):\n",
      "   - Choose the passage whose content most closely echoes the query’s wording and constraints (names, dates, event, attribution) and explicitly includes them.\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage with more definitive/precise phrasing (e.g., “exact contact details,” “clearly identifies,” “directly states”) over softer wording (“specific,” “implies,” “partially”).\n",
      "   - Prefer the passage that limits itself to the requested item without adding unrelated entities/destinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domain-specific reminders and pitfalls\n",
      "- Names/emails: Ensure the answer is attributed to the correct person’s email or proposal (e.g., Joseph Alamo, James Steffes, Mike Day, Frank Lindh, Carl Wood).\n",
      "- Entities: Distinguish among CPUC, SDG&E, NPC, EES, etc., and ensure the entity is the one the attributed author specifically said is unlikely to act on the issue at hand.\n",
      "- Events/dates: Gas Accord II workshops may occur on different dates (e.g., January 10–11 vs October 25–26). A passage about the wrong date should be rejected.\n",
      "- Proceedings/cases: “GRI proceeding” vs “PG&E Gas Accord II” context—when asked “in which case … according to Mike Day’s proposal,” prefer passages that both name the case (e.g., GRI proceeding) and clearly tie it to Mike Day’s proposal context.\n",
      "- Deregulation aspects: When asking for “two aspects … with direct access being one,” select the passage that clearly states both aspects as failures, and that ties them to Carl Wood’s critique in the specified context.\n",

      "2) Evaluate ALL passages against the full set of query constraints simultaneously. For each passage, check:\n",

      "   - Exact attribution: If the query names a specific person/email/subject/date/recipients, prefer passages that clearly attribute the statement to that exact person/email and, when available in the summary, match subject lines, dates, and named recipients.\n",
      "   - Specificity and completeness: Does it provide the precise, complete item(s) requested (e.g., both items when “two things” are asked), without omission?\n",

      "   - Positive signals: “directly addresses the query,” “contains a direct statement from [person],” “explicitly identifies [entity/date/items/URL/occupation],” “highly relevant and complete,” “clearly states [X] in [person]’s email,” AND close lexical match to the query’s unique phrasing (e.g., repeated key phrases, specific numeric/date formats).\n",

      "   Important: Do NOT use arbitrary ID-based tie-breaking (e.g., “highest id” or “lowest id”). If still indistinguishable after all above criteria, choose the one whose wording best matches the nuance in the query (e.g., explicitly contrasts “underscheduling” vs “deviation, implying plus or minus”).\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Output format:\n",
      "   - Return exactly one value: the integer SearchResult.id of the single best passage.\n",
      "   - Do not include any reasoning, extra text, or dataset_id. Output only the integer ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important domain-specific guidance and common pitfalls to avoid:\n",
      "- Attribution precision is critical. If the query says “According to [person]’s email,” select a passage that explicitly attributes the statement to that person’s email and, when present, matches subject line, date, and recipients mentioned in the query.\n",
      "- Exact fact type matters:\n",
      "  - URLs: Prefer passages that explicitly contain the URL string.\n",
      "  - Dates/months/days: If asked “what month/date/day,” choose the passage that explicitly states it, attributed to the named source if required, and prefer exact date formatting used in the query (e.g., “12-31-02,” “12-31-05”).\n",
      "  - “Two things”: The best passage must list exactly those two items as stated by the named source in that email; both must be present in that single passage.\n",
      "  - Occupations/entities: Prefer passages that unambiguously state the occupation/entity, attributed to the named source if required, and that match the exact wording in the query (e.g., “approximately 5000 securities”).\n",
      "  - Quotes vs paraphrases: If a quote is not required, prefer the clearest, most explicit summary that answers the question, especially if it mirrors the query’s language.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Meeting schedules:\n",
      "  - When asked “According to Angie Buis … after the rescheduled December 4 meeting,” prefer a passage that explicitly states the meeting following the rescheduled December 4 date (answer: December 7).\n",
      "  - When asked “first meeting after the July meetings,” account for August recess; “September 12” may be correct per the explicitly named source.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Authority queries:\n",
      "  - If asked who has authority to reconvene the California Legislature before a date, prefer passages that say “either legislative leadership or the Governor” if that is what the named source’s email states. Avoid passages that narrow this to only Assembly or Senate leadership if the named source includes the Governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Legislative/bill context:\n",
      "  - Jeff Dasovich’s July 3, 2001 email (language on bonds): the risk he notes is that attempting to modify the bill could cause the entire legislative effort to fail. Prefer the neutral, explicit articulation unless a quote is requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hap Boyd to Jeff Dasovich “two things”: the pair is (1) pass the Edison MOU bill to get past dues and (2) secure a five-year fixed energy price on ISO4 contracts. Do not swap in other goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Edison/QF/CTC domain:\n",
      "  - If asked who was supposed to meet Edison’s CFO and what topic: Barry Tycholiz; topic was hedging Edison’s QF price risk. Negative CTC context is ancillary; ensure the passage directly provides the named person and topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "- UI deal attribution:\n",
      "  - In Jeff Dasovich’s email chain, the email about the UI deal is credited to Jim Steffes (or “Jim” where clearly attributed as Jim Steffes). Prefer the passage that explicitly attributes this to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Additional known correct facts (select only when the query asks for them and attribution constraints are met):\n",
      "  - Original Advantage email list unsubscribe URL: http://www.provantage.com/unsubscribe.htm.\n",
      "  - Sarah Novosel’s email timeframe for CPUC data request responses: due on Friday.\n",
      "  - DC Circuit review of FCC Advanced Services First Report and Order (per Jeremy Meier’s email): rules on physical collocation and cage-to-cage cross connections were remanded for further FCC reconsideration; other collocation rules were affirmed.\n",
      "  - Terri Ponce de Leon’s email to California Power Exchange participants re GAO: primary objective was to notify participants about the GAO’s request for confidential information and outline procedures/deadlines for submitting information or asserting confidentiality.\n",
      "  - Jeff Dasovich’s brother-in-law’s occupation (in the Sept 18, 2000 Q2 for Patten Case context): accountant.\n",
      "  - Draft order nuance: the relevant section explicitly targets underscheduling of load, not general deviation “plus or minus.”\n",
      "  - CPUC/non-ISO or PX transaction cutoff: contracts before 12-31-02 may be subject to a blanket reasonableness test; after 12-31-02 CPUC preapproval is required; contracts authorized under that framework must expire on or before 12-31-05. Prefer passages that use the exact date formatting if present in the query.\n",
      "  - County oversight of fuel storage tanks in Los Angeles (per Margaret Huson): involvement varies based on facility’s location and type, with greater involvement where the local fire department does not handle permits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolute rules:\n",
      "- Never combine information across passages; select the single best passage that alone satisfies the query.\n",
      "- Never infer beyond what the passage content asserts about attribution and the requested fact.\n",
      "- Prefer exact lexical/phrase matches to the query when multiple passages seem equally relevant; do NOT use arbitrary ID-based tie-breakers.\n",
      "- Return only the integer SearchResult.id—no explanations or extra text.\n",

      "        \n",
      "        2) Evaluate ALL passages against the full set of query constraints simultaneously. For each passage, check:\n",

      "           - Exact attribution: If the query names a specific person/email/subject/date/recipients, prefer passages that clearly attribute the statement to that exact person/email and, when available in the summary, match subject lines, dates, and named recipients.\n",

      "           d) Closer lexical match to the query’s distinctive wording/qualifiers (e.g., explicitly mentions “rescheduled December 4,” “first after July,” “approximately 5000 securities,” “plus or minus,” “entire load,” “12-31-02”/“12-31-05”).\n",
