## Weaviate and Composio

This guide demonstrates how to use Weaviate and Composio together. Composio provides pre-defined actions for a large number of applications like Gmail, Slack, Trello etc. and allows us to create seamless integrations between these apps and LLMs/agents. Using these tools, we can control and manage a lot of the data that is generated and received by users. For example, the `gmail_new_gmail_message` trigger can be used to wait for a new email and when the mail arrives, the provided callback function gets executed with access to the new mail data. By connecting agents to a user's apps and leveraging a vector database like Weaviate to store, search, and manage data, we can create more personalized and contextually relevant agents.
