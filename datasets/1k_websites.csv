Foundation stone has been laid for a new university in Jhargram. The students of this district can study here only. We are setting up new Ol Chiki medium schools. We will appoint 200 teachers in Ol Chiki language. Some people with vested interests are trying to incite violence between communities. There was a time when Jangalmahal was stricken with violence. But peace has returned now. Educational and employment opportunities have opened up. We have given Sikshashree scholarships to SC/ST students. The money is directly transferred to their bank accounts. We are conducting WBCS exam in Ol Chiki now.,http://aitcofficial.org/aitc/adivasi-dibas-to-be-celebrated-today/

I’d been anticipating and dreading this moment for seventeen days, since Saturday, December 19, the morning of my last final in Pascal. The day I was scheduled to go back to Pittsburgh was also the day I finally received my grades. I earned an easy A in Astronomy, a B- in Pascal, and a C in Honors Calc. All three of those grades I expected. The C in East Asian History was completely unexpected. My grade point average for the semester gave me a 2.63 to start my postsecondary career.

Healey and Pfund analyzed several types of government policies that promote energy growth, including taxes, regulations, research and development investments, direct market provision, use of government services – i.e. seaports; and disbursements such as grants or loans. They argued that “energy transitions fueled” our economic growth from wood powering our frontier days, coal powering our railroads and the Industrial Revolution, and finally with oil reaching the mainstream with the internal combustion engine (Healey & Pfund, 2011).
