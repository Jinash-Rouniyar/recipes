## Contribution Guidelines for Adding Recipe to Weaviate Website

Requirement: For a recipe to be added to the website, it should be a Python notebook

In your PR, you should make sure you've completed the following steps:

1. Add an entry for your recipe into `index.toml`. Add any relevant and optional tags: `tags: a list of topic tags`, `agent: true or false`, `integration: true or false` etc.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python scripts/generate_markdowns.py`: This will generate a markdown version of your recipe including the frontmatter needed for the website. Check that the markdown looks correct and fix any errors that running this script causes.
4. Create the PR which should incliude: your recipe, an edit to the `index.toml` as well as the genreated markdown in `markdowns/`

> üåÖ Handling images: If your recipe has an image displayed in it, we recommend embedding the image via it's github url.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are making changed to the `recipes` repository layout, please make sure you've corrected the recipe paths in `index.toml` if they have changed location!

## Feedback ‚ùì
Please note this is an ongoing project, and updates will be made frequently. If you have a feature you would like to see, please create a GitHub issue or feel free to contribute one yourself!
